SECURE FILE MANAGEMENT APPLICATION

File server - file storage location for upload/download/delete
LDAP server - client authentication
Database server - permissions management? or is that LDAP as well?
certificate (SSL) server - secure connection management

1. Attempt connection to file server, opening a secure connection through SSL server.
2. Authenticate through LDAP server
3. Connect to file server
4. Permissions are managed upon successful login by LDAP or database server, not sure which.
5. Upload/download/delete files.
6. Logout and close secure connection.


**Side Notes - Extra, Unnecessary Bits**
Establish secure connection timeouts of say... 5 minutes? Is there a default?
