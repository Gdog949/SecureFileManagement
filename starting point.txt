SECURE FILE MANAGEMENT APPLICATION

File server - file storage location for upload/download/delete
LDAP server - client authentication
Database server - permissions management? or is that LDAP as well?
certificate (SSL) server - secure connection management

1. Attempt connection to file server, opening a secure connection through SSL server.
2. Authenticate through LDAP server
3. Connect to file server
4. Permissions are managed upon successful login by LDAP or database server, not sure which.
5. Upload/download/delete files.
6. Logout and close secure connection.

Is this going to be 2 separate programs? One for clients, and one for the file server to 
manage files while interacting with client permissions? Or can we somehow incorporate both
elements into a single program? Is this going to all be run on a single system or several, 
which would require introducing networking into the program?


**Side Notes - Extra, Unnecessary Bits**
Establish secure connection timeouts of say... 5 minutes? Is there a default?
