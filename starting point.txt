SECURE FILE MANAGEMENT APPLICATION

File server - file storage location for upload/download/delete
LDAP server - client authentication
Database server - permissions management? or is that LDAP as well?
certificate (SSL) server - secure connection management

1. Attempt connection to file server, opening a secure connection through SSL server.
2. Authenticate through LDAP server.
3. Finalize connection to file server if authenticated successfully.
4. Permissions are managed upon successful login by LDAP or database server, not sure which.
5. Upload/download/delete files, while ensuring other clients' files are inaccessible and invisible.
6. Logout and close secure connection.

Ideally, this will be a single program to manage everything from client authentication and permissions checking/management to file manipulation. I think we can use a lot of
open source code for this project to fill in large parts, like managing the SSL connection; I'm sure that's been perfected already, so no need to re-invent the wheel here.
Re-use open source code where possible.


**Side Notes - Extra, Unnecessary Bits**
Establish secure connection timeouts of say... 5 minutes? Is there a default?
